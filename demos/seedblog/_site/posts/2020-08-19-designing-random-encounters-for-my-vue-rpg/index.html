<h2>Designing Random Encounters for my Vue RPG</h2>
<p>
Written: 8/18/2020
</p>


<p>So I'm still piddling away at my RPG in Vue.js. To be clear, I'm never going to finish it. But you can read about it here (<a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/2020/07/17/testing-vuejs-application-files-that-arent-components">Testing Vue.js Application Files That Aren't Components</a>) and here (<a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/2020/07/19/making-monsters-with-javascript">Making Monsters with JavaScript</a>). Over the past few months I've been slowly reading an incredible book for RPG lovers, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1999353307/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1999353307&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=raymondcamd06-20&amp;linkId=077052bcad5a83b2c2d8292cc5b61619">The CRPG Book</a>. It's a review of over 400 games over the past 40 years of computer role-playing.</p>
<p>While reading the book, I'm discovering some cool features that older games had and that I missed while growing up. (Or possibly just don't remember.) A few games have mentioned using encounters with simple &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; logic. Basically, you are presented with something and given a choice of options. No combat, just simple choices.</p>
<p>The more I thought about this the more I thought it could be an interesting part of my game. If you imagine that there's a random chance of combat as you walk around (part of the core gameplay I want to have), then there could be a smaller chance of a simple encounter. I'd imagine these happening maybe once or twice per gameplay so somewhat rare, but they would be a break from the typical combat encounter.</p>
<p>I designed my system with the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encounters are in an array, randomly chosen.</li>
<li>Each encounter has hard coded text and is static.</li>
<li>Each enouncter has hard coded options.</li>
<li>However, each option has random results.</li>
<li>Results can impact player stats, for example, draining health or giving your gold.</li>
<li>Finally, each encounter has an optional &quot;prereq&quot;. This is a 'safety' check to make things a bit easier for results. So if a result drains 10 gold, I don't want to have to worry about negative balances. Ditto for death. While I'm fine with an encounter harming you, I didn't want it to kill you. I can say this point is one I'm reconsidering and may roll back. For gold, I could simply let it take all your gold and leave you at 0, and for harmful encounters, it may be kinda fun if some could actually kill you.</li>
</ul>
<p>My data structure than looks like so:</p>
<ul>
<li>prereq: If passed, a string that is evaluated against player data, like "hp>10". If false, this encounter can't happen.</li>
<li>text: The text of the encounter.</li>
<li>options: An array of options where:
<ul>
<li>text: The text of the option</li>
<li>results: An array of results based on this option where one is randomly selected. Each result has:
<ul>
<li>text: The text describing the result.</li>
<li>effect: An effect, if any, on the player, also a string that is evaluated, like gold+=10.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">{
	prereq:'gold&gt;0 &amp;&amp; hp&gt;0',
	text:'You meet a beggar who asks for help. He looks desperate.',
	options: [
		{
			text: 'Give a gold coin to him.',
			results:[
				{ text: 'The beggar thanks you!', effect:'gold--' }, 
				{ text: 'The beggar thanks you, winks, and dissappears.', effect:'gold += 300'}, // it was a god or whatever in disguise
				{ text: 'The beggar smirks and punches you!', effect:'hp--' }
			]
		},
		{
			text: 'Walk away.',
			results:[
				{ text: 'The beggar spits at you!', effect:'' }, // no effect
				{ text: 'The beggar growls and punshes you!', effect:'hp--' }
			]
		},

	]
},
</code></pre>
<p>The JavaScript utility has two main methods. The first returns a random encounter that's filtered by prereqs. A player object is passed in (I'm not using TypeScript so what I really mean is a &quot;simple object representation&quot; of the player). The next method takes a player object, an encounter, and a selected option. It figures out the random result and applies the effect. Here's the entire utility.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import { misc } from './misc'

const data = [
	{
		prereq:'gold&gt;0 &amp;&amp; hp&gt;0',
		text:'You meet a beggar who asks for help. He looks desperate.',
		options: [
			{
				text: 'Give a gold coin to him.',
				results:[
					{ text: 'The beggar thanks you!', effect:'gold--' }, 
					{ text: 'The beggar thanks you, winks, and dissappears.', effect:'gold += 300'}, // it was a god or whatever in disguise
					{ text: 'The beggar smirks and punches you!', effect:'hp--' }
				]
			},
			{
				text: 'Walk away.',
				results:[
					{ text: 'The beggar spits at you!', effect:'' }, // no effect
					{ text: 'The beggar growls and punshes you!', effect:'hp--' }
				]
			},

		]
	},
	{
		prereq:'hp&gt;0',
		text:'You hear a growl from behind you.',
		options: [
			{
				text: 'Put on a brave face.',
				results:[
					{ text: 'You seem to have scared off whatever was stalking you.', effect:'exp+=100' }
				]
			},
			{
				text: 'Run away',
				results:[
					{ text: 'You run until your out of breath.' , effect:'' }, // no effect
					{ text: 'You run, but trip and sprain your ankle!', effect:'hp--' }
				]
			},

		]
	}
]
export const encounterMaker = {
 
	// given a player ob, find an encounter they can do
	select(player) {
		let possibleEncounters = data.filter(d =&gt; {
			if(!d.prereq) return true;
			let prereq = fixEvalString(d.prereq);
			return eval(prereq);
		});
		if(possibleEncounters.length === 0) return null;
		return possibleEncounters[misc.getRandomIntInclusive(0, possibleEncounters.length-1)];
	},
	resolve(player, encounter, choice) {
		if(choice &gt;= encounter.options.length) choice = 0;
		let selected = encounter.options[choice];
		let result = selected.results[misc.getRandomIntInclusive(0, selected.results.length-1)];
		console.log('result for '+choice, result);
		if(result.effect != '') {
			console.log(player);
			eval(fixEvalString(result.effect));
			console.log(player);
		}
		return player;
	}

}

// utility function to fix eval string to include player
function fixEvalString(str) {
	str = str.replace(/gold/g, 'player.gold');
	str = str.replace(/hp/g, 'player.hp');
	str = str.replace(/exp/g, 'player.exp');
	return str;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The two methods I described above are defined as <code>select</code> and <code>resolve</code>. Notice that I wrote a function, <code>fixEvalString</code>, that can be used by my prereqs and effects to modify the player. This feels like bad code. I mean, eval is bad in general. Given that I know the &quot;shape&quot; of my player data I could switch to another way of doing this, but I'll worry about that when I finish the game, which is, you know, never.</p>
<p>I did build a utility to help test this, and here's what it looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">/*
Ray, run with: node -r esm test.js
*/

import { encounterMaker } from '../src/utils/encounterMaker'

console.log('basic player');
console.log(encounterMaker.select({
	gold:10,
	hp:10
}));

console.log('poor player');
console.log(encounterMaker.select({
	gold:0,
	hp:10
}));

console.log('dead player');
console.log(encounterMaker.select({
	gold:10,
	hp:0
}));
console.log('---------------------------------');
console.log('basic player resolve');
let player = {
	gold:10, hp: 10, exp:200
};
let enc = encounterMaker.select(player);
console.log('chosen enc', enc);
player = encounterMaker.resolve(player, enc, 0);
console.log('Player at end', player);
player = encounterMaker.resolve(player, enc, 1);
console.log('Player at end2', player);
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, I've got a few <code>select</code> calls and a few <code>resolve</code> ones. The output looks like so:</p>
<pre><code>basic player
{
  prereq: 'hp&gt;0',
  text: 'You hear a growl from behind you.',
  options: [
    { text: 'Put on a brave face.', results: [Array] },
    { text: 'Run away', results: [Array] }
  ]
}
poor player
{
  prereq: 'hp&gt;0',
  text: 'You hear a growl from behind you.',
  options: [
    { text: 'Put on a brave face.', results: [Array] },
    { text: 'Run away', results: [Array] }
  ]
}
dead player
null
---------------------------------
basic player resolve
chosen enc {
  prereq: 'gold&gt;0 &amp;&amp; hp&gt;0',
  text: 'You meet a beggar who asks for help. He looks desperate.',
  options: [
    { text: 'Give a gold coin to him.', results: [Array] },
    { text: 'Walk away.', results: [Array] }
  ]
}
result for 0 { text: 'The beggar thanks you!', effect: 'gold--' }
{ gold: 10, hp: 10, exp: 200 }
{ gold: 9, hp: 10, exp: 200 }
Player at end { gold: 9, hp: 10, exp: 200 }
result for 1 { text: 'The beggar spits at you!', effect: '' }
Player at end2 { gold: 9, hp: 10, exp: 200 }

I think next I'm going to take a stab and creating a map. I've been hashing around some ideas for a few weeks now and I think I'm ready to put pen to paper so to speak.</p>
