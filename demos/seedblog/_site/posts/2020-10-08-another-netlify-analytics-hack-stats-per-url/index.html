<h2>Another Netlify Analytics Hack - Stats Per URL</h2>
<p>
Written: 10/7/2020
</p>


<p>I've blogged a few times on the Netlify Analytics API (<a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/2019/10/05/building-a-netlify-stats-viewer-in-vuejs">&quot;Building a Netlify Stats Viewer in Vue.js&quot;</a>) and <a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/2020/05/18/integrating-netlify-analytics-and-eleventy">&quot;Integrating Netlify Analytics and Eleventy&quot;</a>) and today I've got some more code to share. Now - every time I do this - I remind folks that there is <em>not</em> a published doc for the Netlify Analytics API. That is still the case. Today I'll also add that what I'm sharing is <em>very</em> rough. It worked for me and it's up on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/netlify-analytics-api">repo</a>), but just keep in mind that I wrote this as a tool for myself. If it can help you too, great!</p>
<p>For a while now I've wished I had a way to get analytics about a particular blog post. Netlify's analytics for page views are all date-based. I can easily tell what pages were viewed over a time period. But what I really wanted was the ability to see page views for a post over <em>all</em> time.</p>
<p>I decided to take a crack at it with some Node.js scripts. Why Note and not a client-side application? In order to get my stats, I'd need access to <em>all</em> of my data. Technically not everything for a recent blog post, but if I wanted to search more generically, like <code>/2020</code> to see page views for my content this year, I'd need analytics from the beginning of the year. Therefore I took this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, I wrote a script that gets data for one specific data. It stores this in a folder.</li>
<li>I wrote a script that takes the saved data from a cache and creates one array of URL and view counts.</li>
<li>I built a Vue app that sucks in the resulting JSON and let's me do a quick filter.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's take a look at these - and again - remember this is rough code. Let's call it - organic, farm fed, all-natural code. First up is <code>get.js</code>, which, as you can guess, sucks in data.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">require('dotenv').config();
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const fs = require('fs');

const token = process.env.NETLIFY_TOKEN;
const siteId = process.env.NETLIFY_SITEID;

// Earliest will be documented
let earliest = new Date(2019,10,1);

/*
to do, determine START DATE
look at cache and see what's done
do last+1 day + X more, probably 10
*/

/*
let begin = new Date(2019,10,1);
let end = new Date(begin);
end.setDate(begin.getDate() + 1);
console.log(begin, end);
*/
async function getForDay(from, siteId, token) {
	
	let to = new Date(from);
	to.setDate(from.getDate()+1);

	let url = `https://analytics.services.netlify.com/v1/${siteId}/pages?from=${from.getTime()}&amp;to=${to.getTime()}&amp;timezone=-0500&amp;limit=99999`;
	
	let result = await fetch(url, {
		headers: {
			'Authorization':`Bearer ${token}`
		}
	});
	return (await result.json()).data;

}

/*
I look at my cache folder and see which files exist. Each file is
YYYY-MM-DD.json
and from this, I can figure out my most recent time
*/
function getLastCacheDate() {
	let files = fs.readdirSync('./cache');
	if(files.length === 0) return;
	let latest = new Date(1980,0,1);
	files.forEach(f =&gt; {
		let d = f.split('.')[0];
		let [y,m,dom] = d.split('-');
		let date = new Date(y, m-1, dom);
		if(date.getTime() &gt; latest.getTime()) {
			latest = date;
		}
	});
	return latest;
}

(async () =&gt; {
	for(let i=0;i&lt;1;i++) {
		let latest = getLastCacheDate();
		let begin = earliest;
		if(latest) {
			begin = new Date(latest);
			begin.setDate(latest.getDate()+1);
		} 

		console.log('Fetch for '+begin);
		let data = await getForDay(begin, siteId, token);
		console.log(`Data loaded, ${data.length} items`);
		let fileName = `./cache/${begin.getFullYear()}-${(begin.getMonth()+1)}-${begin.getDate()}.json`;
		fs.writeFileSync(fileName, JSON.stringify(data), 'utf-8');
		console.log(`${fileName} written.`);
	}
})();
</code></pre>
<p>From the top, I begin by using two env variables. The token is a personal access token as I described in my <a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/2020/05/18/integrating-netlify-analytics-and-eleventy">last post</a>. The site ID represents my blog, where you are right now. This part:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// Earliest will be documented
let earliest = new Date(2019,10,1);
</code></pre>
<p>Comes from the fact that the analytics API returns data about how long it's been generating logs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">ingestion: {
    status: 'current',
    ingestion_start: 1575158400000,
    ingestion_end: 1602014400000
}
</code></pre>
<p>I converted <code>ingestion_start</code> to a date to get what you see in earliest. You could pick any date really. The <code>getForDay</code> function handles actually hitting the API and that's actually the simplest part of this whole script.</p>
<p>If you scroll down into the main block, you'll first see an odd loop, from 0 to 1. Once I got my code working, I was sucking down 25 days at a time. I felt like that was safe and not abusive to Netlify's API. However, I never wrote code to &quot;stop&quot; at the current day. So as I got close to October 6th (the last time I played with this I believe), I simply reduced the counter by hand. Hack.</p>
<p>Next, <code>getLastCacheDate</code> looks at my cache folder to figure out when I last ran the code. My cache files are named YYYY-MM-DD to make it easier to work with dates, but I still screwed this up a few times. I'm actually running this in the loop which is a bit wasteful, but I'm ok with that.</p>
<p>Finally, I take the resulting data and just store it. The results look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">[
	{
		&quot;path&quot;: &quot;/2015/05/17/a-simple-cordova-task-runner-for-visual-studio-code/&quot;,
		&quot;count&quot;: 4
	},
	{
		&quot;path&quot;: &quot;/2006/03/30/Soundings-ColdFusion-Survey-Update-151&quot;,
		&quot;count&quot;: 4
	},
	{
		&quot;path&quot;: &quot;/2004/11/15/3D322D18-EEB5-E4F3-C9B08B0042A17015&quot;,
		&quot;count&quot;: 4
	},
	{
		&quot;path&quot;: &quot;/2017/03/23/check-out-paveai-for-analytics/&quot;,
		&quot;count&quot;: 4
	},
	// LOTS MORE ROWS!
]
</code></pre>
<p>My next script, <code>read.js</code>, handles combining these files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const fs = require('fs');

let files = fs.readdirSync('./cache');
let fileData = {};

files.forEach(f =&gt; {
	let data = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('./cache/'+f, 'UTF-8'));
	data.forEach(i =&gt; {
		if(!fileData[i.path]) fileData[i.path]=0;
		fileData[i.path] += parseInt(i.count,10);
	});
});

let keys = Object.keys(fileData);
keys = keys.sort((a,b) =&gt; {
	if(fileData[a] &lt; fileData[b]) return 1;
	if(fileData[a] &gt; fileData[b]) return -1;
	return 0;
});


let sorted = [];

keys.forEach(k =&gt; {
	sorted.push({path:k, views:fileData[k]});
	//console.log(k.padEnd(80)+' '+fileData[k]);
});
console.log(JSON.stringify(sorted));
</code></pre>
<p>I read them all, create one big array, sort it such that the highest viewed pages are on top, and then output it. Here's another snippet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">[
	{
		&quot;path&quot;: &quot;/&quot;,
		&quot;views&quot;: 68778
	},
	{

<p>To be honest, I was really surprised to see NativeScript as my number one post. It's also incredibly depressing to see how many pages get just around a hundred views of so. Of course, my blog was up for a roughly 16 years before I enabled Netlify Analytics so I'm going to worry most about my most recent content.</p>
<p>I ran <code>read.js</code> and saved the output to <code>output.json</code>. I then built this horribly simple Vue app:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
input {
	width:400px;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;app&quot;&gt;
	&lt;input v-model=&quot;search&quot; type=&quot;search&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter a search term here (3 char min)&quot;&gt;
	&lt;span v-if=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Total for this search: &lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;table v-if=&quot;results&quot;&gt;
		&lt;thead&gt;
			&lt;tr&gt;
				&lt;th&gt;Path&lt;/th&gt;
				&lt;th&gt;Views&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;/thead&gt;
		&lt;tr v-for=&quot;result in results&quot;&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
const app = new Vue({
	el:'#app',
	data:{
		data:null,
		search:''
	},
	async created() {
		let resp = await fetch('./output.json');
		console.log('test');
		try {
			this.data = await resp.json();
		} catch(e) {
			console.log('wtf');
			console.error(e);
		}
	},
	computed: {
		results() {
			if(this.search.length &lt; 3 || !this.data) return;
			return this.data.filter(d =&gt; {
				return d.path.indexOf(this.search) &gt;= 0;
			});
		},
		total() {
			if(!this.results || this.results.length === 0) return 0;
			return this.results.reduce((prev,curr) =&gt; {
				return prev + curr.views;
			}, 0);
		}
	}
});
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Which basically has a form field on top and a table of results:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2020/10/a1.jpg" alt="Table of results" class="lazyload imgborder imgcenter">
</p>
<p>64K page views on my vue content is pretty nice. I can also search by year since my pages follow a date based path system:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2020/10/a2.jpg" alt="Using /2020 as the path" class="lazyload imgborder imgcenter">
</p>
<p>Not bad for a year that is totally insane and hellish, right?</p>
<p>And that's it. Again, you can grab the code at the <a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/netlify-analytics-api">repo</a> if you wish and if folks have some ideas for improvements, I'm all ears. For now my plan is to update my cache every now and then, take a look, and carry on writing blog posts a few people read. :)</p>
