<h2>Quick Tips for Eleventy and Vercel</h2>
<p>

<p>I primarily use <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a> for my Jamstack hosting service, but I also make use of <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> quite a bit as well. Vercel's CLI is quite nice and tends to be a bit more intelligent about figuring out your site's requirements with little to no configuration. Other things, like their <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/serverless-functions/introduction">serverless functions</a>, are a bit easier to use as well. That being said, I've recently run into a small issue with Eleventy and Vercel that I thought I'd share in case others hit as well. It isn't a bug, but a combination of a few things together that may trip you up.</p>
<p>To start, I create a two file Eleventy site. It's got a home page:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">
&lt;h1&gt;Cats&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
{% for cat in cats %}
&lt;li&gt;{{cat.name}}&lt;/li&gt;
{% endfor %}
&lt;/ul&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>All I'm doing here is iterating over an array of cats. That data comes from <code>_data/cats.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">[
	{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Luna&quot;},
	{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Cracker&quot;},
	{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Pig&quot;},
	{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Aleese&quot;},
	{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Sammy&quot;}
]
</code></pre>
<p>Just to confirm it works, I ran <code>eleventy --serve</code> and hit the page in my browser.</p>

</p>
<p>Awesome, right? Ok, so if I want to run this with Vercel and use it's local dev server, I'd probably try: <code>vercel dev</code>. However, doing so will result in this:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2021/03/ve2.jpg" alt="The CLI doesn't know the framework." class="lazyload imgborder imgcenter">
</p>
<p>Notice how it doesn't recognize the framework? That's because, at least for me, I use my globally installed Eleventy CLI and do not install it locally. I may be in the minority for that, but that's typically how I role. Luckily it's easy enough to fix. First I'll do an <code>npm init -f</code> to create a blank package.json. Next I'll do a <code>npm i --save @11ty/eleventy</code> to set Eleventy as a dependency. Now if I run <code>vercel dev</code>, it recognizes that I'm using Eleventy.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Cool! Except when it starts, I get this:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2021/03/ve4.jpg" alt="Error on startup" class="lazyload imgborder imgcenter">
</p>
<p>It may be a bit hard to read in the screen shot, but here's some of the relevant bits:</p>
<pre><code>
`TemplateContentRenderError` was thrown
&gt; Having trouble compiling template ./node_modules/liquidjs/README.md


</code></pre>
<p>Notice how the error is being thrown in a file in node_modules? Why?</p>
<p>By default, Eleventy ignores the node_modules folder, which is a good thing. However, if you have a .gitignore file, this feature isn't enabled (unless it's empty). This is <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/ignores/#node_modules-exemption">documented</a> of course. So what happened? The Vercel CLI creates a .gitignore file if you don't have one. It does this to tell Git to ignore the .vercel folder it creates.</p>
<p>So now you have a .gitignore file and Eleventy won't ignore node_modules anymore. The fix, of course, is to just add it:</p>
<pre><code>.vercel
node_modules
</code></pre>
<p>This will also speed up your development server as it's ignoring the ten billion or so files under node_modules.</p>
<p>As I said, none of this is a bug, but it's tripped me up a few times now so I thought I'd share!</p>
