<h2>Adding Google Calendar to Your Jamstack - with Pipedream</h2>
<p>

<p>Late last year (remember last year - sigh) I wrote up a post demonstrating how to integrate Google Calendar into your static web site: <a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/2019/11/18/adding-google-calendar-to-your-jamstack">&quot;Adding Google Calendar to your JAMStack&quot;</a>. In that article, I describe how I used Google's Node libraries to read my event data. While it was mostly painless, authentication was a bit difficult to figure out. Also, I ended the post with this warning:</p>
<blockquote>
So, this solution isn't perfect. If you add, edit, or delete an event, it won't be reflected on the site. However, you could simply do daily builds of your site via a CRON job let it be updated at that point. Or do a manual update if you want.
</blockquote>
<p>A few days I was thinking about this usecase and realized I could probably do it a lot easier making use of <a href="https://www.pipedream.com">Pipedream</a>. How so? Don't forget that Nelify lets you create a build hook. This is a unique URL that when hit with a POST request will trigger a new build. In theory, all I have to do is create a Pipedream workflow that's fired on new events. How is that done?</p>
<p>After logging into Pipedream and going to my &quot;Source&quot; panel, I created a new source and selected Google Calendar. Pipedream lets you select from a few different types of events (to be clear, I mean programatic events, not calendar events, sorry for the confusion!) including one named, &quot;New Or Updated Event (Instant)&quot;. As the name says, this will run instantly based on <em>any</em> particular edit done to a calendar. I authenticated with Google via Pipedream, selected my calendar (a custom one I made for this blog post), and then took the defaults for the rest. I did specify a name for the source though so it would be easier to find later. (I do a lot of testing!)</p>

</p>
<p>Once this was created, I then made a few edits to my calendar. As I did, I was able to see, instantly, new events. Note that in the screenshot below, the event source code is smart enough to use the calendar event title as a label. That's cool!</p>

</p>
<p>Now that I have an event source that fires when I edit a calendar, the next step was to use it in a workflow. I created a new Pipedream workflow, used my event source as the source. Do <em>not</em> forget that there is a boolean trigger for event sources that &quot;enables&quot; it. Your event source is running, but in the context of the workflow, you must enable it there. This is different from the &quot;active&quot; toggle of the workflow itself and every time I use an event source like this, I forgot to hit the toggle:</p>

</p>
<p>Then I had add a second step. Remember that the idea is to trigger a build. While this is pretty simple code in Node, Pipedream actually has a built in action for performing HTTP requests. I added it, totally did <strong>not</strong> forget to change them ethod to POST, and pasted in the URL I got from the Netlify site settings so I can trigger a build.</p>

</p>
<p>This just left testing. I created an event in Google Calendar, which automatically triggered my event source, which automatically triggered my Netlify build, which then triggers happiness!</p>

</p>
<p>Woot! So in theory I could stop there, but then I thought, if Pipedream makes Google Calendar so easy to use, could I use it in my <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> site instead of the Google Node library I had? Turns out - I certainly could.</p>
<p>I built a new Pipedream workflow with a HTTP trigger. I then added the action, &quot;Google Calendar - Get All Future Events&quot;. Note that there is also a &quot;Get Events&quot; action and that even the &quot;future events&quot; action lets you configure a minimum time, effectively allowing you to get past events too.</p>
<p>This action requires you to paste in the ID of your calendar which you will need to get from your calendar settings. (The event source has a nice dropdown of your available calendars and I've already aksed if the action can be updated to suppor this as well.) Also, there is a default setting, &quot;Single Events&quot;, which takes recurrring events and &quot;collapses&quot; them into one. For my use case, I did <strong>not</strong> want this behavior so I set it to false.</p>
<p>The final step was to simply return the data so I could use this workflow as an API. I added a Node step and wrote this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">$respond({
  status:200,
  body:steps.get_all_future_events.$return_value.items
});
</code></pre>
<p>And that was it, literally. In two minutes, I had an end point I could hit to return Google Calendar events in structured JSON. All the auth was handled by Pipedream.</p>
<p>I went to my Eleventy site and created a new file in my <code>_data</code> folder to use this API:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const PD_EVENTS = 'https://enbfnzb6d0dzhfd.m.pipedream.net';
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

module.exports = async function() {

	return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {

		fetch(PD_EVENTS)
		.then(res =&gt; res.json())
		.then(res =&gt; {
			//console.log(res[1]);
			let events = res.map(e =&gt; fixEvent(e));
			resolve(events);
		});

	});

}

function fixEvent(e) {
	let event = {};

	event.title = e.summary;
	if(e.start.date) event.start = e.start.date;
	if(e.start.dateTime) event.start = e.start.dateTime;
	if(e.end.date) event.end = e.end.date;
	if(e.end.dateTime) event.end = e.end.dateTime;
	if(e.description) event.description = e.description;
	if(e.location) event.location = e.location;

	if(event.start) event.start = new Date(event.start);
	if(event.end) event.end = new Date(event.end);
	return event;
}
</code></pre>
<p>A few things to note here. I could obscure my Pipedream URL by using an evironment variable set by Netlify. I also did some basic data wrangling on the event structure to make it easier to use in my templates. As an example, here's the event's page:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">## Upcoming Events

Here's our upcoming events:

&lt;ul&gt;
{% for event in events %}
&lt;li&gt;{{ event.title }} at {{ event.start | dtFormat }}
{% if event.description %}&lt;br/&gt;{{ event.description }}{% endif %}
{% if event.location %}&lt;br/&gt;Located at {{ event.location }}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
&lt;/ul&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>I could absolutely display my evevents nicer. Heck, I don't even display the end time for events that have it, but you get the basic idea. You can see this yourself here: <a href="https://calendar-eleventy-pd.netlify.app/events/">https://calendar-eleventy-pd.netlify.app/events/</a>.
