<h2>A Guide to Building a Blog in Eleventy</h2>
<p>
Written: 1/19/2022
</p>


<p>About eight months or so I had the idea to write up a guide for building a blog in <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>. It's not difficult of course and others have talked about the process, but I wanted to write something a bit more &quot;formal&quot; than a traditional blog post and something that could be really useful for folks new to the framework. (Framework? Product? You tell me.)</p>
<p>I started writing, and building, and then, yeah, life happened. This may come as a shock to you, but this isn't the first project I started with lofty goals that ended up forgotten.</p>

<p>This past weekend my wife and I had the opportunity to get away for a few days and I started thinking about the guide again. I realized some ways I could do it better, as well as how I could bring it to completion, so I put some work into it and got it to a point where I think it's ready for public consumption!</p>
<p>You can find the guide here: <a href="https://cfjedimaster.github.io/eleventy-blog-guide/guide.html">https://cfjedimaster.github.io/eleventy-blog-guide/guide.html</a>. It's over five thousand words and nearly twenty-five pages with not a single cat picture to be found.</p>
<p>As it explains, you do not need to be an expert in Eleventy for the guide to be useful, but knowing the basic will definitely help. The repository for the guide may be found here: <a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/eleventy-blog-guide">https://github.com/cfjedimaster/eleventy-blog-guide</a> I'd really like to get some feedback on it and would absolutely welcome suggestions, PRs, and more.</p>
<p>Right now the HTML is built from Markdown and wrapped in some HTML to give it basic styling, but I think it could look a bit nicer as well. I'd definitely welcome some help there.</p>
<p>As always, I hope this is useful for folks. If you find it useful, drop me a line and let me know!</p>
