<h2>Building a Vue Application with Serverless on Netlify</h2>

<p>This is something that is - surely - documented in a thousand other blog posts, but it's not something I've tried yet
with Netlify so I thought I'd give it a go. It was this or watch another episode of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; on Netflix and obviously I chose this instead. I'm glad I did because it worked surprisingly well with no real hiccups. I just needed to
&quot;see&quot; it myself at least once to be sure it worked.</p>
<p>Alright, so as the title says, how would you deploy a Vue.js application to Netlify while also making use of their serverless platform? Here's how I did it.</p>
<p>First, I made the Vue application:</p>
<pre><code>vue create vue-netlify-demo -b
</code></pre>
<p>If you've not seen the <code>-b</code> option before, it means &quot;bare&quot; and generates a much smaller Vue application with less boilerplate text. (In my opinion it could be even more bare, but I'll take what I can get.) I didn't change any options because I wasn't worried about testing Vuex or the router.</p>
<p>I then fired up the application with <code>npm run serve</code> and confirmed it worked.</p>

</p>
<p>Next, I started using the <code>netlify dev</code> command. This enables you to test local applications as if they were running on the Netlify platform. I noticed that <code>netlify dev</code> ran <code>npm run serve</code>, but I don't remember that being documented. It was the first script defined in my package.json file and so maybe that's why it fired, but I went with a more specific command: <code>netlify dev -c &quot;npm run serve&quot;</code>. The <code>-c</code> flag specifies the command for the CLI to run.</p>
<p>I noticed that the output that was much more verbose when running via <code>netlify dev</code>. When you use <code>npm run serve</code>, there's a lot of webpack related messages that gets output to one line, constantly being overwritten. It's a lot of noise so I'm fine with that. But when running via <code>netlify dev</code>, they all get output to the screen. This is fine, but you may miss the message stating that the server is up and running:</p>

</p>
<p>Once I saw this message and opened my browser to localhost:8888 I didn't worry about it again. Cool, now let's go serverless.</p>
<p>First, I added a <code>netlify.toml</code> file to my project to specify my functions folder:</p>
<pre><code>[build]
	functions = &quot;.functions&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>I then used the CLI to scaffold a hello-world function: <code>netlify functions:create</code>. This laid down this file in <code>.functions/hello-world/hello-world.js</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// Docs on event and context https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/#the-handler-method
exports.handler = async (event, context) =&gt; {
  try {
    const subject = event.queryStringParameters.name || 'World'
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify({ message: `Hello ${subject}` }),
      // // more keys you can return:
      // headers: { &quot;headerName&quot;: &quot;headerValue&quot;, ... },
      // isBase64Encoded: true,
    }
  } catch (err) {
    return { statusCode: 500, body: err.toString() }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The Netlify Dev environment supports testing serverless functions locally so I modified my little one page Vue application like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;app&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to Your Vue.js App&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
	Message from severless function: {{ msg }}
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      msg:''
    }
  },
  async created() {
    let resp = await fetch('/.netlify/functions/hello-world?name=ray');
    this.msg = (await resp.json()).message;
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>All I've done here is fire off a call to the function (the <code>.netlify/functions</code> path is how you &quot;address&quot; serverless functions on Netlify) and displayed the result. Here's how it looks:</p>
<p>

<p>Beautiful, right? Now to get it live. First, I made a new repo for it: <a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/vue-netlify-demo">https://github.com/cfjedimaster/vue-netlify-demo</a>. Then I made a Netlify site tied to the GitHub repo. I specified <code>npm run build</code> to generate the Vue production version of the app and entered <code>dest</code> for the folder to use as the site source.</p>
<p>And that was it. You can see it running here: <a href="https://vue-netlify-demo.netlify.app/">https://vue-netlify-demo.netlify.app/</a>. And don't forget I linked to the repo right above.</p>
<p>So all in all - no surprises - it just plain worked - which is exactly what I want!</p>
