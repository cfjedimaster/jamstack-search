<h2>Quick Netlify Tip for Redirects</h2>

<p>Since this just bit me in the butt - for the second time - I figured I'd do a real quick blog post. This isn't to help me remember, but to ensure it comes up next time I google for it.</p>
<p>I was working on a local <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> site with the Netlify CLI dev command. For folks who don't know, this lets you simulate the Netlify environment locally. While a great tool, you sometimes run into issues where things behave differently locally compared to production.</p>
<p>For me, I ran into just such an issue Saturday morning. I had set up a simple <code>_redirects</code> file to support giving my serverless functions a nicer, and simpler, path:</p>
<pre><code>/api/*	/.netlify/functions/:splat	200
</code></pre>
<p>This worked locally just fine, but in production, I kept getting a 404. Also, when I looked at my deploy log, I saw a message stating that no redirect rules were processed. On a whim, I duplicated my redirect in my <code>netlify.toml</code> file, deployed, and it woked fine.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://answers.netlify.com/t/redirects-not-being-processed-in-production-works-fine-locally/38106">posted</a> on the Netlify forums, and after some back and forth, a Netlify support person asked if my <code>_redirects</code> file was in the published directory. I'm using Eleventy and for non-supported files, you need to tell it to explicitly copy the file to output. This is done with one simple command (I'm sharing a few just to give you more examples):</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy(&quot;css&quot;);
eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy(&quot;js&quot;);
eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy(&quot;images&quot;);
eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy(&quot;fonts&quot;);
eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy(&quot;_redirects&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>As soon as I did that, and deployed, it worked perfectly. I do find it odd that a <code>netlify.toml</code> file in the root of my project works fine, even though it's not copied to output, but <code>_redirects</code> has to be copied for it to work. I think it should be consistent.</p>
<p>Anyway - as I said - this hit me twice now so hopefully I won't forget.</p>
