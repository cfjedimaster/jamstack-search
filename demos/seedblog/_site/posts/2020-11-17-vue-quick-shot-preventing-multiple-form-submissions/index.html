<h2>Vue Quick Shot - Preventing Multiple Form Submissions</h2>
<p>

<p>Good morning! Before I begin, a quick note. I was about to write this post yesterday when I discovered that it was actually very close to another one I wrote a few months back, which was my very first <a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/tags/vue+quick+shot">Vue Quick Shot</a> - <a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/2020/03/02/vue-quick-shot-disabling-a-submit-button-while-waiting-for-an-ajax-call">&quot;Vue Quick Shot - Disabling a Submit Button While Waiting for an Ajax Call&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>In that post, I describe how to modify a form that performs a network call to an API such that you can't submit the request until the first request is done. Today's post is very similar. I was inspired by a post earlier this week on the topic, <a href="https://www.bram.us/2020/11/04/preventing-double-form-submissions/">&quot;HTML Forms: How (and Why) to Prevent Double Form Submissions&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>In today's post, the difference is rather slight. Instead of a form used to collect data before making an Ajax call, it's going to be a &quot;regular&quot; form that just posts to an action, leaving the current page completely. The solution is incredibly similar, but as it's my blog I figure I'm allowed to do that. ;)</p>
<p>I also want to point out that if this is the <em>only</em> thing you're doing on a page, Vue's going to be overkill. Just use vanilla JS instead (and see my note at the end). But if you're already using Vue,perhaps for some complex client-side validation, then the following tip will help.</p>
<p>I started off building a <a href="https://pipedream.com/@raymondcamden/slow-html-form-test-p_LQCq6z/edit">Pipedream workflow</a> that merely outputs HTML after a four second wait. This You can test this yourself if you view it yourself: <a href="https://enz7ceue7sb4c7j.m.pipedream.net">https://enz7ceue7sb4c7j.m.pipedream.net</a>. I'm not doing any form validation or handling, I'm just waiting four seconds and responding.</p>
<p>I then built a simple form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;form action=&quot;https://enz7ceue7sb4c7j.m.pipedream.net/&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
  &lt;label for=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; id=&quot;name&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And then I submitting the form, clicking rapidly to send multiple requests. Pipedream records executions of workflows, and I could see multiple firing at once:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>So let's fix it! Again, I want to stress that if this is the only thing you're doing on a page, Vue is going to be overkill. First, I modified the HTML a bit:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div id=&quot;app&quot; v-cloak&gt;
  
  &lt;form action=&quot;https://enz7ceue7sb4c7j.m.pipedream.net/&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; @submit=&quot;setSubmitting&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; id=&quot;name&quot;&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; :disabled=&quot;submitting&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I've got a <code>submit</code> handler on the form and my submit button has a <code>disabled</code> property tied to a variable. And then here's the simple Vue.js code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const app = new Vue({
  el:'#app',
  data:{
    submitting:false
  },
  methods: {
    setSubmitting() { 
      this.submitting = true; 
    }
  }
})
</code></pre>
<p>Yeah, pretty trivial. But effective. Test it out here:</p>
