<h2>Vue Quick Shot - Links, Links, and More Links</h2>
<p>
Written: 3/5/2020
</p>


<p>Welcome to the final entry in my Vue Quick Shot series. I'll share all the links at the end of this post. I hope this week's series has been helpful and if you enjoyed it, please drop me a comment and I'll definitely consider doing another series in the future. For my fifth and final Vue Quick Shot, I'm not going to write a line of code. Instead I'm going to share links to resources that have helped me learn Vue and become a better developer. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of everything out there for Vue, but rather a more focused list on things that helped me personally.</p>

<p/>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/">The Docs</a> - It should come as no surprise that the core docs are where any new developer should start. I'd only point out that you shouldn't miss the excellent <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/cookbook/">Cookbook</a> as well. I didn't notice it for months.</li>
<li><a href="https://forum.vuejs.org/">Vue Forum</a> - The official Vue forum. Pretty heavily used and you typically get an answer to anything relatively soon. There's also a pretty busy <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vue.js">Stackoverflow tag</a> for Vue.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue">Amazing Vue</a> - A huge list of cool things done in Vue. Basically if you need X for Vue, check here first.</li>
<li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/intro-to-vue-1-rendering-directives-events/">Sarah Drasner on CSS-Tricks</a> - Part one of a five part series on Vue. It's especially good in the animations area, a part of Vue I've never played with.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools">Devtools Extension</a> - The devtools extension is nice, and supported in most browsers, but may be more useful to people using Vuex. Honestly unless I'm using Vuex, I just use console messages.</li>
<li>Newsletters - You can, and should, sign up for both the <a href="https://news.vuejs.org">official newsletter</a> and the
<a href="https://vuejsdevelopers.com/newsletter/">Vue.js Developers</a> newsletter. For those of us who can't spend all day glued to Twitter, this is the best way to get the news about what's going on with Vue.</li>
<li>And finally, I've got nearly 100 posts <a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/tags/vuejs">tagged with Vue</a> and at least a few of them are worth your time. I also write about Vue from time to time for other publications and I keep a list of them on my <a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/about/">About</a> page.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it! I hope these small nuggets have been helpful to you this week, and as I said, leave me a comment below with your thoughts!</p>
