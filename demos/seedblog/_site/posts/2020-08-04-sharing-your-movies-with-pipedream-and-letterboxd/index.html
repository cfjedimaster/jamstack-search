<h2>Sharing Your Movies with Pipedream and Letterboxd</h2>
<p>
Written: 8/3/2020
</p>


<p>I recently discovered <a href="https://letterboxd.com/">Letterboxd</a> via a cool example of integrating it's data with Eleventy (<a href="https://smithtimmytim.com/blog/2020/create-a-film-diary-with-eleventy-and-letterboxd/">&quot;Show Off Your Letterboxd Film Diary with Eleventy&quot;</a>). Letterboxd is a site (and app) that lets you track the movies you've watched and give reviews and ratings. I'm a huge fan of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">GoodReads</a> for keeping track of the books I've read and I'm going to give Letterboxd a try as well. My wife and I are both huge movie nerds so I thought it would be kind of cool to have a list of movies I've watched when the year finally ends.</p>
<p>While there isn't a proper API yet (apparently it's in <a href="https://letterboxd.com/api-beta/">beta now</a>), every account has an RSS feed setup. Here's mine: <a href="https://letterboxd.com/raymondcamden/rss/">https://letterboxd.com/raymondcamden/rss/</a></p>
<p>While we all know what RSS looks like (ok, maybe it's just me), Letterboxd has quite a few extensions to the specification that provide additional data about your films. Here's one entry (which is all I've got for now - I've told the site about a bunch of old movies I've watched but have only &quot;logged&quot; one review so far):</p>

<p>Everything with the <code>letterboxd:</code> prefix is a namespaced set of data that they've added to provide more information to the feed. Looking at this, and the blog entry I shared earlier, it occurred to me that it would be easy to build an integration between this and <a href="https://pipedream.com">Pipedream</a>. I got this working and you can see it below.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I just watched John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City and rated it a 4.0. See my <br>review at <a href="https://t.co/4sPdaLTFeJ">https://t.co/4sPdaLTFeJ</a>.</p>&mdash; moonpicbot (@moonpicbot) <a href="https://twitter.com/moonpicbot/status/1290761974893219842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>Notice - when I &quot;play&quot; like this, I use one of my bot accounts, not my main account. If I continue to use Letterboxd I'll update my workflow to post to my main account. Alright, so how was this built?</p>
<p>The first step of my workflow was an RSS event source. I first wrote about Pipedream's <a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/2020/05/07/looking-at-pipedreams-event-sources">event sources</a> back in May. It's a powerful way to build workflows built on custom events. One of the events built in is an RSS feed parser that runs every fifteen minutes and on a new RSS entry will emit an event. With this as the source of my workflow I've got a serverless function that will execute automatically whenever I do a new movie review. (Well, within fifteen minutes.)</p>
<p>The next step was a custom Node step. I did two things in here. First, I wanted to get the URL of the image for the movie. In that blog entry I shared earlier, they used a npm package called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/letterboxd">letterboxd</a>. This is a cool little package that abstracts away the complete logic of reading and parsing the RSS feed. But for me, the RSS feed was already parsed, I just needed the &quot;find the image logic&quot;.</p>
<p>I went to the GitHub repo, opened up <a href="https://github.com/zaccolley/letterboxd/blob/master/index.js">index.js</a>, and found the <code>getImage</code> function. I took the logic from there and incorporated it into my Node step:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">async (event, steps) =&gt; {
	const cheerio = require('cheerio');

	/*
	This logic taken from the https://github.com/zaccolley/letterboxd package. The package assumes it is doing
	all the network stuff and I just needed the image parsing part.
	*/
	getImage = function(description) {
		var $ = cheerio.load(description);

		// find the film poster and grab it's src
		var image = $('p img').attr('src');

		// if the film has no image return no object
		if (!image) {
			return false;
		}

		return {
			tiny: image.replace('-0-150-0-225-crop', '-0-35-0-50-crop'),
			small: image.replace('-0-150-0-225-crop', '-0-70-0-105-crop'),
			medium: image,
			large: image.replace('-0-150-0-225-crop', '-0-230-0-345-crop')
		};
	}

	let imgdata = getImage(steps.trigger.event.description);
	let text = `
I just watched ${steps.trigger.event['letterboxd:filmtitle']['#']} and rated it a ${steps.trigger.event[&quot;letterboxd:memberrating&quot;][&quot;#&quot;]}. See my 
review at ${steps.trigger.event.link}.
	`;

	return {
		text, imgdata
	};

}
</code></pre>
<p>The second thing I did was to simply write up the text I wanted to tweet. I used the custom values from the RSS feed to get the title and rating.</p>
<p>By the way, make note of the use of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio">cheerio</a> package. This is an awesome implementation of jQuery on the server and works really darn well for cases where you need to parse HTML as a string.</p>
<p>So at this point, I've got images (multiple to pick from) and text. My plan was to tweet with the image so to do that you first need to upload the image. I picked the pre-built <code>upload_media_to_twitter</code> step where all I did was plugin my URL param: <code>steps.parseEntry.$return_value.imgdata.medium</code>.</p>
<p>Lastly, I used the <code>post_tweet</code> step with two params: status was <code>steps.parseEntry.$return_value.text</code> and media ids was <code>steps.upload_media_to_twitter.$return_value</code>.</p>
<p>And that's it. You can see the complete workflow here: <a href="https://pipedream.com/@raymondcamden/letterboxd-to-twitter-p_V9CVvK/">https://pipedream.com/@raymondcamden/letterboxd-to-twitter-p_V9CVvK/</a> As I mention every time, don't forget you can copy this workflow to your own Pipedream account and use it as you will. Enjoy!</p>
