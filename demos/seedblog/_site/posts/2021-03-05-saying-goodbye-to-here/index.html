<h2>Saying Goodbye to HERE</h2>
<p>
Written: 3/4/2021
</p>


<p>I just shared this on Twitter, but I figured it would make sense to share a quick post here as well. After nearly two years (I know, that sounds like so long right?), I've decided to move on from <a href="https://here.com">HERE</a>. I had an incredibly good time working at HERE and was lucky enough to work with people who were all better than me. I learned a lot and feel like I'm taking valuable knowledge with me into my next role.</p>
<p>Speaking of that next role - I'll be starting my new job on the 15th. I'll say then where it is but anyone who reads the blog could make a good guess.</p>
<p>Wish me luck!</p>
