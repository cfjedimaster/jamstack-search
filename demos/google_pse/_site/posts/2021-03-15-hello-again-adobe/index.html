<h2>Hello (Again), Adobe!</h2>

<p>A few days ago I <a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/2021/03/05/saying-goodbye-to-here">shared</a> that I was leaving HERE Technologies and starting a new role. Today I'm doing something new - returning to a company I've worked at before. Today I'm starting a new role as a Senior Developer Evangelist for Adobe, focusing on the <a href="https://www.adobe.io/apis/documentcloud/dcsdk/">document services APIs</a> that you may have noticed me blogging about the last few weeks.</p>
<p>This new opportunity really came out of nowhere. I didn't even know they were hiring. I caught up with an old friend, discovered what she was doing, and when I saw what they were working on (and that they were hiring), I thought it would be a great fit.</p>
<p>I first got introduced to the power of PDFs when I worked with ColdFusion. Maybe ten or so years ago, the ColdFusion team added in basic support for PDF manipulation and inspection by integrating a version of LiveCycle. Honestly back then PDFs didn't really interest me, but I typically tried to test every aspect of a new version of ColdFusion. I started playing with the integration, and it just really struck a chord with me. I also started paying more attention to the PDF space in general, the capabilities, and more.</p>
<p>When I saw what the document services teams we're working on (the client-side library, the APIs, and more), and started playing with them myself, I got pretty excited, and I'm thrilled to be able to join this team and help introduce the tools to everyone.</p>
<p>I'll still be blogging about Jamstack, Vue, JavaScript, development, and of course, cats, so please wish me good luck as I start my (second) first day at Adobe!</p>
