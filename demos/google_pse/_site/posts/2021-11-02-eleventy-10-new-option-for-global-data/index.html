<h2>Eleventy 1.0 - New Option for Global Data</h2>
<p>

<p>Like my <a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/2021/10/15/eleventy-10-dynamic-ignores">last post</a>, this is going to be another minor example, but it's yet another cool <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-v1-beta/">Eleventy 1.0</a> I'm happy to see added. (Even if I won't use it much - more on that towards the end.) Today's post is all about a new way to add global data to Eleventy, the new <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-global-custom/"><code>addGlobalData</code></a> function.</p>
<p>Before Eleventy 1.0, you could define global data for your templates by using the <code>_data</code> folder (the exact name being configurable as well). In that folder you could drop in either a JSON or JavaScript file. JSON was good for setting hard coded values. Here's one I use here called <code>site.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{

		{&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;/subscribe/&quot;},
		{&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Contact&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;/contact/&quot;},
		{&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Search&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;/search/&quot;}

<p>JavaScript files lets you create data more dynamically. So for example, if I wanted to include Star Wars ship data in my templates, I could created <code>ships.js</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const fetch = require('node-fetch');

module.exports = async function() {
	let resp = await fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/films/');
	let films = await resp.json();
	return films.results;
};
</code></pre>
<p>Now in Eleventy 1.0, there's an API you can use in yuour configuration file to specify the same kind of data. So for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">eleventyConfig.addGlobalData('name', 'Eleventy Test Site');

eleventyConfig.addGlobalData('complex', {
	facebook:'facebook foo',
	twitter:'twittet goo',
	insta:'insta zoo'
});
</code></pre>
<p>I used a simple string and object above, but any valid data works here. You can also use functions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">eleventyConfig.addGlobalData('generated', () =&gt; {
	let now = new Date();
	return new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', { dateStyle: 'full', timeStyle: 'long' }).format(now);
});
</code></pre>
<p>As well as async functions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">eleventyConfig.addGlobalData('ships', async () =&gt; {
	let shipRequest = await fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/starships');
	let ships = await shipRequest.json();
	return ships.results;
});
</code></pre>
<p>You can return promises as well if async/await isn't your thing.</p>
<p>This all works as expected so obviously I tried to break it a bit. One thing I was curious about was whether or not you could access <em>all</em> your global data. So I tried this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">eleventyConfig.addGlobalData('test', Object.keys(eleventyConfig.globalData));
</code></pre>
<p>And it works. The <code>test</code> object was a list of the keys to all my data. But - and this is an important but - it only contains the key created before this particular line runs. If for some reason you add stuff afterwards, it won't reflect those changes. On a whim, I tried this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">eleventyConfig.on('beforeBuild', () =&gt; {
	console.log('beforeBuild');
	eleventyConfig.addGlobalData('test2', Object.keys(eleventyConfig.globalData));
	console.log('done', JSON.stringify(eleventyConfig.globalData));
});
</code></pre>
<p>And while I can confirm the log message above showed <code>test2</code>, my templates did not have access to it. I've got an <a href="https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/discussions/2062">open question</a> about this on the Eleventy discussion board.</p>
<p>So... I like this! Will I use it? Probably not! Why? Right now I feel like my Eleventy config file is a bit complex, especially for this site. Having my global data in <code>_data</code> makes me feel like things are a bit more organized. I also like having it there from a source control perspective. If I change one of the values in <code>site.json</code>, I'd like that history to keep to itself if that makes sense. However, I cannot stress how much I appreciate that Eleventy provides multiple different ways of solving problems. One of the reasons I've ditched other static site generators is due to overly perscriptive functionality. I think it's great we've got multiple options now for this feature.</p>
<p>Don't forget that Eleventy has a &quot;order of priority&quot; when it comes to data. You can see this list at the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-global-custom/#sources-of-data">&quot;Sources of Data&quot;</a> documentation. Let me know what you think.</p>
