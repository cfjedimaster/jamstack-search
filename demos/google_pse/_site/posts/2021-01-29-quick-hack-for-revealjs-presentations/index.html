<h2>Quick Hack for Reveal.js Presentations</h2>
<p>
Written: 1/28/2021
</p>


<p>I go back and forth between creating presentations in PowerPoint and <a href="https://revealjs.com/">Reveal.js</a>. Both have features I really like a lot, but as I'm primarily talking about web development, I tend to prefer Reveal.js as it isn't quite as jarring to go from slide to code/demonstration as it is when PowerPoint is displaying.</p>
<p>Like PowerPoint, Reveal.js has a &quot;notes&quot; feature that lets you add notes to individual slides. I use this a lot as I tend to write less text on my slide and rely on the fact that - hello - I'm talking and my slide should only support my talk, not be a replacement for the awesomeness that is my speaking ability. (I'm kidding by the way.)</p>
<p>In Reveal.js, slide notes are written in an <code>aside</code> tag that is hidden from view in the presentation. Here's a real example from the talk I just gave.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;section&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Demo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cfjedimaster/eleventy_algolia&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;github.com/cfjedimaster/eleventy_algolia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://eleventyalgolia.netlify.app/&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;eleventyalgolia.netlify.app/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;
This is my particular solution using Netlify and algolia-indexing
go to eleventy_algolia 
show that its a blog
.functions/deploy-succeeded
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Note that in the notes above, I used line breaks to seperate each &quot;part&quot; of my note. Mentally I read that as a timeline to go along with the current slide.</p>
<p>When giving a Reveal.js presentation, you can open up the speaker view in another window by just hitting the <code>S</code> key. Here's how that slide looks.</p>

</p>
<p>It may be a bit hard to see in the screen shot above, so here's another one focused on the lower right side panel:</p>

</p>
<p>Notice what happened? My notes are all on one line. If you think about it, that makes sense. Reveal.js is HTML based and while I treated the notes area like I would have in PowerPoint, it's still HTML, which means a line break is meaningless outside a <code>pre</code> tag.</p>
<p>I could easily fix that by adding some <code>br</code> tags, but honestly, when I'm in the &quot;flow&quot; of working on a good presentation, I don't want to have to worry about that. That's one thing PowerPoint does really well - as a slide authoring environment it's incredible.</p>

</p>
<p>Since I knew I couldn't rely on me remembering to include proper HTML, I turned to the solution every developer turns to when they want to <strike>break</strike>&quot;enhance&quot; HTML - JavaScript! I added this quick snippet right before I initialize Reveal.js:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">let notes = document.querySelectorAll('aside.notes');
notes.forEach(n =&gt; {
	let html = n.innerHTML;
	html = html.trim().replace(/\n/g, '&lt;br/&gt;');
	n.innerHTML = html;
});
</code></pre>
<p>This could be done in one line but I'm not currently doing a technical code test so why bother pretending. The result is a slighly better view:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>There's probably a nicer way of doing this, but it works for me!</p>
