<h2>Using the PDF Embed API with Vue.js</h2>
<p>

<p>I've recently become acquainted with Adobe's <a href="https://www.adobe.io/apis/documentcloud/dcsdk/pdf-embed.html">PDF Embed API</a>. As you can probably guess by the name, it's a library for embedded PDFs on a web page. Not just a simple viewer, it has APIs for interacting with the PDF as well really good mobile support. This is a part of the <a href="https://www.adobe.io/apis/documentcloud/dcsdk/">Document Cloud</a> service which provides other PDF tools as well (extraction, conversion, and so forth). I've been playing with the viewer a bit and wanted to see what Vue.js integration would look like. Here's my solution, but note that I'm still learning about the product so it could probably be done better.</p>
<p>First off, to use the API you need a key. Clicking the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/go/dcsdks_credentials">link from the webpage</a> will walk you through the process of generating a key. One important note on this though. You have to lock down your key to a domain and that domain can not be changed either. Also, you can only specify one domain. So if you want your domain <em>and</em> localhost, create two projects, generate two keys, and set them as environment variables for your development and production environment. I did my testing on CodePen and had to use this domain: cdpn.io</p>
<p>Once you have a key, you can copy the code from the <a href="https://www.adobe.io/apis/documentcloud/dcsdk/docs.html?view=view">Getting Started</a> to quickly test. Here it is in its entirety as it's pretty short:</p>

&lt;/head&gt;

 &lt;div id=&quot;adobe-dc-view&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;script src=&quot;https://documentcloud.adobe.com/view-sdk/main.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    document.addEventListener(&quot;adobe_dc_view_sdk.ready&quot;, function()
    {
        var adobeDCView = new AdobeDC.View({clientId: &quot;&lt;YOUR_CLIENT_ID&gt;&quot;, divId: &quot;adobe-dc-view&quot;});
        adobeDCView.previewFile(
       {
          content:   {location: {url: &quot;https://documentcloud.adobe.com/view-sdk-demo/PDFs/Bodea Brochure.pdf&quot;}},
          metaData: {fileName: &quot;Bodea Brochure.pdf&quot;}
       });
    });
 &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

<p>Breaking this down, you listen for an event signifying that the library is loaded and then create a new &quot;view&quot; based on a div in your HTML. (In the example above, <code>adobe-dc-view</code>.) Once that's done you can use the <code>previewFile</code> method to add it the PDF viewer to the page. Here's a screen shot of this particular example:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>I realize that screen shot is a bit small, but in case you can't see it, the viewer includes the tools you would normally expect in Acrobat - navigation, search, as well as annotation tools. You can even save directly from the viewer and include your annotations. Here is my attempt at making life insurance documents more fun.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Cool. So as I said, it's a pretty powerful embedded viewer, and I want to play with it more later, but I first wanted to take a stab at adding it to a simple Vue.js application. Here's how I did it.</p>
<p>First off, notice in the code listing above that we listen for an event on the document object, <code>adobe_dc_view_sdk.ready</code>. For my code to work in Vue I needed something a bit more robust. An Adobian on the support forum <a href="https://community.adobe.com/t5/document-services-apis/adobe-dc-view-sdk-ready/m-p/11648022#M948">noted</a> that you can check for <code>window.AdobeDC</code> to see if the library is ready. I wrote my code such that the <code>created</code> method of my Vue app can check that and still handle the library being loaded library. Broadly I did it by using a variable, <code>pdfAPIReady</code>. My <code>created</code> method does this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">created() {
	//credit: https://community.adobe.com/t5/document-services-apis/adobe-dc-view-sdk-ready/m-p/11648022#M948
	if(window.AdobeDC) this.pdfAPIReady = true;
}, 
</code></pre>
<p>I then add a watcher for that variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">watch: {
  pdfAPIReady(val) {
    // should only be called when true, but be sure
    if(val) {
      this.adobeDCView = new AdobeDC.View({
        clientId: ADOBE_KEY, 
        divId: &quot;pdf-view&quot;
      });
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>And the final bit is a listener <em>outside</em> my Vue application. Remember that you can access the <code>data</code> variable using the Vue instance. This is how I handled that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// In theory I'm not needed on CodePen, but in the real world I would be.
document.addEventListener(&quot;adobe_dc_view_sdk.ready&quot;, () =&gt; { app.pdfAPIReady = true; });
</code></pre>
<p>Now, in theory, my Vue app can make use of the library. The Adobe docs describe how to use <a href="https://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/dcsdk_io/viewSDK/howtos.html#passing-file-content">local file content</a> driven by an HTML input tag. Basically you can pass a FileReader promise to the embed and it will handle knowing when the local file is read and then render it.</p>
<p>Here's the HTML I used for my demo:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div id=&quot;app&quot; v-cloak&gt;

  &lt;strong&gt;Select a PDF to Preview&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; accept=&quot;application/pdf&quot; @change=&quot;previewPDF&quot; ref=&quot;fileInput&quot;&gt; 

  &lt;h3 v-if=&quot;pdfSelected&quot;&gt;PDF Preview:&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;pdf-view&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the <code>pdfSelected</code> conditional. This is going to toggle after the user has selected a file. I originally had this in a div around the h3 and the div (<code>pdf-view</code>), but the embed viewer didn't like its div being hidden by Vue. (I could probably change how I hide the div, but for now I'm leaving it.) Now for the JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const ADOBE_KEY = 'b9151e8d6a0b4d798e0f8d7950efea91';

const app = new Vue({
  el:'#app',
  data:{
    pdfAPIReady:false,
    adobeDCView:null,
    pdfSelected:false
  }, 
  created() {
    //credit: https://community.adobe.com/t5/document-services-apis/adobe-dc-view-sdk-ready/m-p/11648022#M948
    if(window.AdobeDC) this.pdfAPIReady = true;
  }, 
  methods: {
    previewPDF() {
      let files = this.$refs.fileInput.files;
      if(files.length === 0) return;
      this.pdfSelected = true;
      let reader = new FileReader();
      let viewer = this.adobeDCView;
      console.log(`going to view ${files[0].name}`);
      reader.onloadend = function(e) {
        let filePromise = Promise.resolve(e.target.result);
        viewer.previewFile({
          content: { promise: filePromise }, 
          metaData: { fileName: files[0].name }
        });
      };
      reader.readAsArrayBuffer(files[0]);
 
    }
  },
  watch: {
    pdfAPIReady(val) {
      // should only be called when true, but be sure
      if(val) {
        this.adobeDCView = new AdobeDC.View({
          clientId: ADOBE_KEY, 
          divId: &quot;pdf-view&quot;
        });
      }
    }
  }
})

// In theory I'm not needed on CodePen, but in the real world I would be.
document.addEventListener(&quot;adobe_dc_view_sdk.ready&quot;, () =&gt; { app.pdfAPIReady = true; });
</code></pre>
<p>For the most part, all I did was use Adobe's example of reading a file and moved it inside a Vue method. The end result lets you select a local PDF and have it rendered on my Vue app:</p>

</p>
<p>As I said, this is a rather simple integration, but hopefully useful to folks wanting to use it with Vue. I've got some more examples coming! You can find the complete source code below.</p>
