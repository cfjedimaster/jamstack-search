<h2>Working with Front Matter in Python</h2>

<p>Happy day! Yesterday I discovered a bug in the script I built to search my blog content (see my <a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/2022/01/03/building-a-file-search-script-in-python">last post</a> for details. My search script uses Python to parse my blog content, try to find matches to a list of input terms, and return the result. I noticed that one result, when clicked, led to a 404. Why?</p>
<p>My original script used the filename as a way to determine both the date and URL for a post. My Markdown files actually contain both the date and URL in their front matter, but I figured I didn't need to bother parsing that. Turns out, I was wrong. For reasons that are boring and not terribly important, it's possible the day referenced in a filename may not match the day used in the URL.</p>
<p>With that realization I decided to update my search script to support parsing the front matter so I could safely get the URL and date. There's multiple Python libraries for YAML, and I actually started going down that route with the thinking that I'd read in my blog post, split the front matter out, and then parse, when I did a bit more searching and came across <a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-frontmatter/">python-frontmatter</a>. This is a Python module that will parse a file (or string) of a page that includes front matter and give you both the front matter as a dictionary and the rest of the content as a string. It's perfect! So imagine this source:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: My Cats
categories: [&quot;cats&quot;,&quot;pets&quot;]
description: Why cats are better than dogs.
---

This is the rest of the content.
</code></pre>
<p>After using pip to install <code>python-frontmatter</code>, you can use it like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import frontmatter

input = &quot;&quot;&quot;
---
title: My Cats
categories: [&quot;cats&quot;,&quot;pets&quot;]
description: Why cats are better than dogs.
---

This is the rest of the content.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

data = frontmatter.loads(input)

print(&quot;Title&quot;, data[&quot;title&quot;])
print(&quot;Categories&quot;, data[&quot;categories&quot;])
print(&quot;Description&quot;, data[&quot;description&quot;])

print(&quot;Content&quot;, data.content)
</code></pre>
<p>Keys in front matter can be addressed in dictionary-style in the result and <code>.content</code> can be used to reference the text after the front matter. Here's what the above outputs:</p>
<pre><code>Title My Cats
Categories ['cats', 'pets']
Description Why cats are better than dogs.
Content This is the rest of the content.
</code></pre>
<p>Cool. So I began to modify my search script. First, I modified <code>makeIndex</code> to use the module:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def makeIndex(f):
	result = []
	for file in f:
		with open(file) as reader:
			
			content = reader.read()

			# to parse the yaml, we need to get just the front matter
			data = frontmatter.loads(content)

			result.append({
				&quot;content&quot;:data.content,
				&quot;date&quot;:data[&quot;date&quot;],
				&quot;path&quot;:data[&quot;permalink&quot;]
			})

	return result
</code></pre>
<p>You can see it's a heck of a lot simpler than the previous version. The next modification was to the results display. My dates now included times which I didn't really need. I also modified how the URL was printed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for result in result:
	# create url based on path
	url = &quot;https://www.raymondcamden.com&quot; + result[&quot;path&quot;]
	# for printing the date, just need the part before T
	print(result[&quot;date&quot;].split(&quot;T&quot;)[0],&quot;-&gt;&quot;,url)
</code></pre>
<p>Here's sample output:</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-frontmatter/">docs</a> for more information on what the module can do as I only used what was necessary for my script.
