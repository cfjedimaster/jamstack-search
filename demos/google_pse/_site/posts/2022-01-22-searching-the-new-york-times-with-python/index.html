<h2>Searching the New York Times with Python</h2>
<p>

<p>In my effort to keep practicing Python and build fun stuff to help me learn, today I built a few demos of using the <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/">New York Times API</a>. I last played with this <em>way</em> back in 2014: <a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/2014/09/15/using-the-new-york-times-api-to-chart-occurrences-in-headlines">&quot;Using the New York Times API to Chart Occurrences in Headlines&quot;</a>. In that demo I let you enter a simple search term and then I report on the number of occurrences of that term over time. I think my favorite image from that post is a search for &quot;Internet&quot;:</p>

</p>
<p>Today the API popped up back in my head and I thought it would be fun to play with it again, this time in Python. I had some success with it today and thought I'd share the results. It's nothing too exciting and is basic Python stuff, but I love getting the practice and I did learn a bit, so that's always a good use of my time, especially on a Saturday, right?</p>
<p>Note that the <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/">New York Times API</a> is free. You can sign up and get a key in seconds. Oddly, they don't link to their <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/faq">FAQ</a> which includes important information about their rate limiting. (Spoiler - I hit it.) Definitely reference that before you go live with any real code.</p>
<p>My first demo makes use of the general <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/archive-product/1/overview">Archive API</a>. My intent was to return a random article for a day in history. Here's that script.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import requests 
from datetime import datetime 
import random 

year = 1964
month = 1
day = 9
api = f&quot;https://api.nytimes.com/svc/archive/v1/{year}/{month}.json?api-key=myKeyBringsTheBoystoTheYard&quot;

def filter_by_day(list, day):
	result = []
	for article in list:
		d = datetime.strptime(article[&quot;pub_date&quot;], &quot;%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z&quot;)
		if d.day == day:
			result.append(article)
	return result

response = requests.get(api)
data = response.json()
articles = data[&quot;response&quot;][&quot;docs&quot;]

# First, get by day
articles = filter_by_day(articles, day)

print(&quot;Total&quot;,data[&quot;response&quot;][&quot;meta&quot;][&quot;hits&quot;])
print(&quot;Total for today&quot;, len(articles))

selected = random.choice(articles)
print(selected[&quot;headline&quot;][&quot;main&quot;])
</code></pre>
<p>The day, month, and year, are all hard coded here. The Archive API lets you filter by year and month, not day, so first I get all the articles for a month and then I filter it down to ones that match the target date. Dates are still pretty hard for me in Python. I used <code>strptime</code> to get the day value out of the resutls from the API and had to build the match by hand. I wonder if Python has a way to make that simpler - like - look at the string and take a guess?</p>
<p>Anyway, once I've filtered to articles for a day, I then <code>random.choice</code> to pick one. I then print out the headline. I ran this a few times and here's the output:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>For my second iteration, I simply removed the hard coded year, month, and day. This gave me a bit more practice with Python date support. You can see that in the top portion of the code below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import requests 
from datetime import datetime 
from datetime import date
import calendar

import random 
import sys

KEY = &quot;damnRightItsBetterThanYours&quot;

# earliest year supported by NYT API
NYT_MIN_YEAR = 1851

lastYear = (date.today()).year-1
year = random.randint(NYT_MIN_YEAR, lastYear)
print(&quot;Select year&quot;, year)

month = random.randint(1,12)
print(&quot;Select month&quot;, month)

daysInMonth = calendar.monthrange(year,month)[1]
day = random.randint(1, daysInMonth)
print(&quot;Selected day&quot;, day)


api = f&quot;https://api.nytimes.com/svc/archive/v1/{year}/{month}.json?api-key={KEY}&quot;

def filter_by_day(list, day):
	result = []
	for article in list:
		d = datetime.strptime(article[&quot;pub_date&quot;], &quot;%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z&quot;)
		if d.day == day:
			result.append(article)
	return result

response = requests.get(api)
data = response.json()
articles = data[&quot;response&quot;][&quot;docs&quot;]

# First, get by day
articles = filter_by_day(articles, day)

print(&quot;Total&quot;,data[&quot;response&quot;][&quot;meta&quot;][&quot;hits&quot;])
print(&quot;Total for today&quot;, len(articles))

selected = random.choice(articles)
print(selected[&quot;headline&quot;][&quot;main&quot;])
</code></pre>
<p>Getting a random year and month was easy thanks to Python's <code>random</code> library. Figuring out the total number of days in the month was a bit harder, and by that I mean I had to google for it. The <code>calendar</code> module provides a simple API for it. I'll be honest - in the past I've been lazy with code like this and simply used 28 as a max day. Don't tell my employers. After that, it's pretty much the same code as before. Get by year/month, filter to day, and select one.</p>

<p>For my final demo, I decided to rebuild the logic I first did nearly ten years ago. Given a term, report on the number of occurrences in headlines over time. Not surprisingly, this is where I first hit the API limits. Thankfully Python has a <code>sleep</code> module to make it easy to 'slow' down my code. I also put a limit of 100 years into the code to make it a bit more reasonable. Here's my little command line utility:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">#!/usr/bin/python

&quot;&quot;&quot;
Given a term X, search for it over years from MIN to now

FYI - the NYT API FAQ: https://developer.nytimes.com/faq

&quot;&quot;&quot;
from datetime import date
import requests
import time 
import sys

KEY = &quot;still kinda secret&quot;

# earliest year supported by NYT API
NYT_MIN_YEAR = 1851

# now 
YEAR = (date.today()).year 

# But to keep things rational, maybe just do 100 years
MIN_YEAR = YEAR - 100

# Given a term, I return the total in a year
def countForTerm(term,year):
	# Note, we filter to one key cuz we only really care about the count
	api = f&quot;https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?&amp;api-key={KEY}&amp;fl=web_url&quot;
	# pass term here, requests will url encode
	response = requests.get(api, params=[(&quot;fq&quot;,f&quot;pub_year:{year} AND headline:{term}&quot;)])
	data = response.json()

	if &quot;fault&quot; in data:
		print(&quot;ERROR:&quot;,data[&quot;fault&quot;][&quot;faultstring&quot;])
		sys.exit()

	total = data[&quot;response&quot;][&quot;meta&quot;][&quot;hits&quot;]

	return total

def main(term):
	# it's an array, but reduce to a string
	term = &quot; &quot;.join(term)
	print(f&quot;Searching for {term} from {MIN_YEAR} to {YEAR}&quot;)
	for year in range(MIN_YEAR, YEAR):
		total = countForTerm(term, year)
		print(year,total)
		time.sleep(6)

if len(sys.argv) == 1:
	print(&quot;Usage: nyt3.py termToSearchFor&quot;)
	sys.exit()

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
   main(sys.argv[1:])

<p>As you can see, this script is meant to be run from the command like per the usage instructions printed if you don't pass an argument. Instead of a fancy graph (which I know Python can do, I'm not quite there yet), I simply output to the terminal. I also discovered that the <code>requests</code> library can handle URL encoding for you. I do that in the second argument to the <code>get</code> call. Also note I'm filtering the results to one key, <code>web_url</code>, because I don't actually care about the matches, just the count. I ran a test on this on &quot;iraq war&quot; and here's the result. I'm sharing this as text and not a graphic as it's quite big:</p>

<p>All in all, fun and fascinating! I've got some ideas on another demo with this but will call it quits for today. Let me know what you think.</p>
