<h2>Eleventy 1.0 - Dynamic Ignores</h2>

<p>So today's <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-v1-beta/">Eleventy 1.0</a> feature is pretty minor, but since I <a href="https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/894">asked</a> for it, it's the most important feature ever! (Ok, no, not really, but I still like it.) Eleventy 1.0 nows supports the ability to dynamically ignore files. What does that mean?</p>

<p>Eleventy can be told to ignore files by using a file named <code>.eleventyignore</code>. This matches the same format as <code>.gitignore</code>. I use this feature on my blog as a way to make local development much quicker. Here's how mine looks:</p>
<pre><code>/_posts/200*/**
/_posts/201*/**
/_posts/2020/**
/_posts/2021/01/**
/_posts/2021/02/**
/_posts/2021/03/**
/_posts/2021/04/**
/_posts/2021/05/**
/node_modules/
</code></pre>
<p>Basically, when working locally I have Eleventy ignore 90% of my previous blog posts. This makes builds go much quicker when I'm writing blog posts or testing other things locally. Note, as the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/ignores/">docs</a> state, you do not have to include things already in your <code>.gitignore</code> so the <code>/node_modules</code> there could be removed.</p>
<p>Because of how I'm using the ignores feature, I'm sure to <em>not</em> include it in my repository as it would nuke most of my content in production. That means everytime I tweak it one place (like my desktop), I have to tweak it in another (like my laptop, and honestly, only if I really care to).</p>
<p>In Eleventy 1.0, you can now both add, and remove, from the ignored files setting via <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/ignores/#configuration-api">configuration</a> settings. So for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">eleventyConfig.ignores.add('/_posts/200*/**');
eleventyConfig.ignores.add('/_posts/201*/**');
eleventyConfig.ignores.add('/_posts/2020*/**');
</code></pre>
<p>You could remove too, via delete:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">eleventyConfig.ignores.delete('/_posts/200*/**');
</code></pre>
<p>All of which means that if you have a case like mine where the ignore files are different based on environment, you could check <code>process.env.NODE_ENV</code> (or some other value) and dynamically ignore based on one environment versus another.</p>
<p>Even better, this is <em>additive</em>. While for me I had no ignores in production, if you had stuff you wanted to ignore <em>everywhere</em> and optionally ignore more in one environment, you can still use <code>.eleventyignore</code> for the global items and the API for the dynamic one.</p>
<p>So again, simple feature, but I'm psyched to see it in Eleventy 1.0!</p>
