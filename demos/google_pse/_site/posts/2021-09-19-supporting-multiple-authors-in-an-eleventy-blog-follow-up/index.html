<h2>Supporting Multiple Authors in an Eleventy Blog - Follow-Up</h2>
<p>
Written: 9/19/2021
</p>


<p>About a year ago I wrote up a blog post demonstrating how to set up an Eleventy blog that supports multiple authors (<a href="https://www.raymondcamden.com/2020/08/24/supporting-multiple-authors-in-an-eleventy-blog">Supporting Multiple Authors in an Eleventy Blog</a>). While you should definitely read that post first, the gist of it goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define authors in a simple JSON data file and ensuring each one has a unique key.</li>
<li>Include an authors field in front matter so you can specify the author</li>
<li>Define a filter that let you get the author's name for the post</li>
<li>Define an author template that shows all the posts for the author</li>
</ul>
<p>While this worked fine, a few days ago I got an email asking if this supported multiple authors <em>per post</em>. Unfortunately, it didn't. Despite me using <code>authors</code> as a front matter key name, if you actually did pass multiple authors it didn't recognize them as a list. I whipped up a quick modification to make this work.</p>
<p>First off, I decided on a simple comma-separated list for multiple authors. Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: Epsilon Post
layout: post
date: 2020-08-02
tags: post
author: brinaldi,rcamden
---

This is Epsilon
</code></pre>
<p>Note that YAML <em>does</em> support specifying an array, or list, but honestly, I find that format not terribly easy to use. (Ok, I'd have to Google it, so it's not <em>that</em> hard.)</p>
<p>After creating a post like this, I had to make two changes. First, consider the previous version of <code>post.md</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">---
layout: main
---

&lt;h2&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/h2&gt;
{% if author %}
	{% assign myAuthor = authors | getAuthor: author %}

	&lt;p&gt;
	Written by &lt;a href=&quot;/authors/{{ author }}&quot;&gt;{{ myAuthor.name }}&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/p&gt;
{% endif %}

{{ content }}

</code></pre>
<p>It makes use of the <code>getAuthor</code> filter to convert the author primary identifier to a real name. To support multiple authors. I first change the <code>getAuthor</code> filter to <code>getAuthors</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">eleventyConfig.addFilter(&quot;getAuthors&quot;, (authors,label) =&gt; {
	let labels = label.split(',');
	return authors.filter(a =&gt; labels.includes(a.key));
});
</code></pre>
<p>All I do here is take the label, split it on commas, an filter to any author in the new array. Then, back in the <code>post.md</code>, I change it to this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">---
layout: main
---

&lt;h2&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/h2&gt;
{% if author %}
	{% assign myAuthors = authors | getAuthors: author %}
	&lt;p&gt;
	Written by 
		{% for theAuthor in myAuthors %}
			&lt;a href=&quot;/authors/{{ theAuthor.key }}&quot;&gt;{{ theAuthor.name }}&lt;/a&gt;{% unless forloop.last %}, {% endunless %}
		{% endfor %}
	&lt;/p&gt;
{% endif %}

{{ content }}
</code></pre>
<p>You can see now that I loop over a list of authors and output a comma if the loop has more than one item. This made individual blog posts work fine. Here's a post with two authors:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2021/09/ma1.jpg" alt="Post showing multiple authors" class="lazyload imgborder imgcenter">
</p>
<p>The second change I had to make was to the authors template. The template was fine, but the <code>getPostsByAuthor</code> filter had to be updated:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">eleventyConfig.addFilter(&quot;getPostsByAuthor&quot;, (posts,author) =&gt; {
	return posts.filter(p =&gt; {
		if(!p.data.author) return false;
		let authors = p.data.author.split(',');
		return authors.includes(author);
	});
});
</code></pre>
<p>And that's basically it. I did <em>not</em> edit the previous demo in my GitHub repository as I wanted a nice way to compare both, so instead I saved this into a new directory: <a href="https://github.com/cfjedimaster/eleventy-demos/tree/master/multiauthor2">https://github.com/cfjedimaster/eleventy-demos/tree/master/multiauthor2</a></p>
<p>As always, if you've got any questions about this, just let me know!</p>
